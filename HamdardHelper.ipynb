Jamia Hamdard (JH) was declared as a deemed-to-be University by the Govt. of India in 1989 on the recommendation of University Grants Commission (UGC) under the UGC Act 1956 in recognition of the services provided by erstwhile educational institutes established by the Hamdard National Foundation (HNF).

It has recently received a generous funding under STUITI, a DST scheme DST's PURSE (Promotion for University Research in Science and Engineering) Grant. Jamia Hamdard was placed at 2nd rank in ho values and 5th in i100 values as per SCOPUS dataset of all the Institutes that were awarded the DST PURSE grant.

Admired by all and counting global dignitaries among his patients, Hakeem Sahab, as he was popularly known, kept public service as his driving force throughout his career. He was conferred with Padma Shri in 1965 and Padma Bhushan in 1992 by the Government of India. He was awarded the prestigious Avicenna Award by the erstwhile USSR in 1983. In October 2000, the Research Centre for Islamic History, Art, and Culture in Istanbul, Turkey, presented the IRCICA Award to him posthumously for ‘Patronage in Preservation of Cultural Heritage and promotion of Scholarship’. He won various other awards and distinctions in his lifetime. He also served as Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University. Over a period of time, Hakim Sahab set up a complex of educational institutions in Hamdard Nagar, Tughlakabad, which were finally amalgamated as Jamia Hamdard (Deemed to be University) in May 1989. The first institute to come up on the Tughlakabad land was the Institute of the History of Medicine and Medical Research (IHMMR). The foundation stone for this institute was laid on November 15, 1962, by the then Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The finished building was later inaugurated by the then Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi. When a Deemed to be University status was granted in 1989, Jamia Hamdard was inaugurated by Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister. Apart from Jamia Hamdard, Hakeem Sahab set up a number of other enduring institutions, including Hamdard National Foundation, Hamdard Education Society, Hamdard Study Circle, Business and Employment Bureau, Hamdard Public School, Ghalib Academy, Centre for South Asian Studies.

The Department not only offers Under Graduate (UG) and Post Graduate (PG) Programmes in Computer Science & Engineering/Computer Application/IT/ECE/Data Science/Cyber Forensics & Information Security but is also engaged in high-quality research activities leading to Ph.D. degree in different thrust areas of computer science and engineering and interdisciplinary areas viz. Big Data, Soft Computing, IoT, Neural Network, Artificial Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, Software Engineering, Data Mining, Information Security, Cyber laws, Cyber Forensics, Computer Architecture, Graph Theory, Computer Networks, Distributed System, Discrete Structure, Robotics, Machine Intelligence, Telecommunication, Mobile Computing, DBMS, Algorithms, VLSI Design etc. to list a few. Department has made a lot of contributions towards these areas in the form of publications in journals/conference-proceedings/books/sponsored research and collaboration with the industry.The department has a huge infrastructure to provide facilities to our students. The department has several smart cluster rooms fully equipped with state of art of technology. It also has 2 computer labs with the latest PCs having an i5 processor with 8 GB RAM and 1 TB storage. The computer lab is fully equipped with the latest Open-Source Software as per our curriculum requirement running on Ubuntu OS. Several PC’s in Computer Lab at 1st floor runs on Windows OS having required software for academics. The Department also has a Research Lab (2nd Floor, Department of CSE) for our Ph.D. students. These labs are fully equipped with Air Conditioning and CCTV cameras have been installed too. The Department has 1 Conference Room with a seating capacity of more than 100 for conducting departmental meetings and student seminars. In ECE domain, we have basic and advanced Electronics & Communication Labs according to the required curriculum. These labs include Analog & Digital Labs, Embedded Systems Lab, FPGA Development kits, DSP Lab, Satellite & Microwave Lab, Digital Design Lab etc. The ECE labs have software as per the academic curriculum and these labs are equipped with updated and advanced instruments. The department also has high-end computing and Artificial Intelligence Lab. Recently the Ministry of Telecommunications, Government of India has awarded 5G Use case Lab to Jamia Hamdard which is among four in NCR Region.The students are provided internships and trainings via the MoU's signed with several setups like the AICTE's Internshala Scheme, Co-Cubes and RnF (for Campus placements), and ETrain India Pvt. Ltd for conducting seminars/workshops which are Microsoft/Adobe certified. These certifications open an arena of opportunities which are unmatched for.The campus placements (On-site or Off-site) have big giants in the industry like TCS, Wipro, HCL, Fiserv, RnF, and Ericcson to name a few which recruit students and they prove to be assets to the industry. Student chapters of International Professional bodies like IEEE, and National like CSI, ISTE, and IETE are to the credit of the Department. These open avenues are wide and enable students to enhance their technical skills. These also help the students to showcase their talent with several non-technical events organized from time to time. Besides exemplary academic record our department also has an MoU with Reaching Sky Foundation (an NGO) which targets the social causes and perform several programs that fall under Unnat Bharat, Govt. of India, scheme.The department has a pool of highly qualified teachers and technical staff members as per UGC/AICTE norms. Several teachers of the department have been awarded/granted National and International patents. The vibrancy of research programs at the department is accentuated by the high-quality publications including books, book chapters, scientific papers and research articles in highly reputed indexed journals with indexing services like SCI, SCIE, SCOPUS and Springer. In addition, Research projects from several govt. agencies like UGC, DST, DBT, DIT, AICTE are to the credit of the faculty members. The department also has an Entrepreneurship cell (E-cell) which motivates the students to think about innovations in day-to-day life. To sensitize students of the department about societal issues related to women, it has an active Women-cell which conducts activities related to women and girl students. An Institution Innovation cell approved by the MHRD's Innovation Cell, Govt. of India has been bestowed upon to the institution. The Department has been recognized by the Department of Science and Technology with a grant approved under the FIST scheme.\",\n",
